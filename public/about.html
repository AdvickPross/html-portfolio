<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Abhijith Prasanth. I'm an Engineering Student from VIT Chennai doing my B.Tech in Computer Science 
  and Engineering with specialisation in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. In the process of upskilling myself, I am learning 
  Full-Stack web development from the basics. This website is just a beginner's Portfolio using only HTML5 and I'm hosting this on GitHub just to
  understand the process. I hope that one day, I am able to create actual websites that impress people at first sight. Till then, guess
  I'll keep learning.
